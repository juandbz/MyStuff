Understanding CAM, TCAM, and MAC Address Tables
.Understanding CAM and TCAM Tables
.Managing MAC Address Table

Switch CAM Table
.Content-Address Memory (CAM) stores Learned MAC Address Information
.MAC Address Learned are time stamped; renewed each frame
.MAC Address moving ports - latest time stamp wins
.Idle CAM entries are kept for 300 seconds (Default)
.Key commands:
  - show mac address-table (or the older 'show mac-address-table')
  - mac address-table static
  - mac address-table aging

Switch TCAM Table
.Ternary CAM (TCAM) is a Layer 3 version of the CAM Table
.Uses ASICs combined with CAM memory to accomplish routing, ACLs, and QOS via Hardware.
.Verify the TCAM utilization with this command:
  - show platform tcam utilization

IOS has more features than ASICs
Layer 3 switches(ASICs) cannot do NAT

Using SDM Templates
.Stackable switches have limited resources that are shared by CAM, TCAM, Etc...
.Verify your usage by using the 'show platform TCAM Utilization'
.Use 'Show SDM Prefer' to find out the usage template assigned
.Use 'Show SDM Prefer ?' to determine which template you should use

Understanding CDP and LLDP
.CDP Concepts and Configuration
.LLDP Concepts and Configuration

.Allows you to see directly connected cisco devices
.Useful for building accurate network diagrams
.Link layer discover protocol is industry standard

Core: Understanding Key Interface Counters
.Runts are severed packets 

Handing Err-disabled ports
.Manually Re-enabling Ports
.Automatically Re-enabling Ports

Handing Err-disabled ports
.Caution: Err-disabled Ports are usually disabled for good reason
.Manual process: Shutdown/No Shutdown
.Automatic process: Err-disabled recovery cause/Err-disable recovery interval
.Verification: Show Err-disable recovery

Handing Power over Ethernet
.Power over Ethernet: Standards and Un-standards
  - cisco inline power (7w)
  - 802.3AF (15.4w)
  - 802.3AT (30w)
  - cisco universal POE (60w)
