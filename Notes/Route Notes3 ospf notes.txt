Understanding OSPF Neighbor Relationships

1 - Determine your own Router ID
. The router ID is simply the router's name in the OSPF Process
. Highest active interface IP address when OSPF starts(Loopbacks beat physical Interfaces)
. Can be hard-coded using the router-ID Command

2 - Add Interfaces to the link state databases (Dictated by the Network command)
. doing this makes the router send hello messages and advertise the network

3 - Send a Hello message on chosen interfaces
. Once every 10 seconds on broadcast/P-2-P Networks
. Once every 30 seconds on NBMA Networks
. Contains all sorts of information:
Router ID			Neighbors
Hello and Dead Timers*		Router Priority
Network Mask*			DR/BDR IP Address
Area ID*			Authenication Password*

4 - Receive Hello
. Check Hello/Dead Interval
. Check NetMasks
. Check Area ID
. Check Authenication Passwords

5 - Send reply hello
. AM I listed as a neighbor in your hello packet?
(If yes, reset Dead timer)
(If no, Add as new Neighbor

6 - Master - Slave Relationship Determined
. Determined by "Priority", Router-ID Breaks Tie
. Master sends Database Description (DBD) Packet
	DBD = Cliff Notes of the Link-state Database
. Slave sends its DBD Packet

7 - DBDs are acknowledged and reviewed
	Slave requests details (Link State Requests - LSR)
	Master Sends Updates (Link state updates - LSU)
	Master requests Details (LSR)
	Slave Sends Updates (LSU)

8 - Neighbors are synchronized! (Full State)

OSPF Neighbor States

.Down - No Hello Packets Have Been Received from a Previously 'Full' Neighbor
.Attempt - Used for manually configured Neighbors

.Init - Hello Packet Received from a new Neighbor
.2-way - Identifies compatible neighbors (Non DR/BDR Relationships may stop here)
.Extstart/Exchange - Master/Slave Relationship determined and DBDs Exchanged
.Loading - The beautiful dance of LSR/LSA/LSU
.Full - The peaceful state of OSPF Nirvana

cost of ospf = 100/BW in Mbps (Can/should be adjusted)
Common Costs:
56k = 1785
64k = 1562
T1 (1544) = 65
E1 (2.048) = 48
Ethernet = 10
Fast Ethernet = 1

Understanding Stub, Totally Stubby, and Not-So-Stubby areas

. BackBone Area			. LSA Type 1: Router LSA
. Standard Area			. LSA Type 2: Network LSA (DR Generated)
. Stub Area			. LSA Type 3: Summary LSA (ABR Summary Route)
. Totally Stubby Area		. LSA Type 4: Summary LSA (ASBR Location)
. Not-So-Stubby Area		. LSA Type 5: External LSA (ASBR Summary Route)
