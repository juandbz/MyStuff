PIM - IP Protocol 103
Intial Multicast flow between Receiver and RP is called shared tree/core tree
Once Mcast Source is discovered, path switches over to SPT(shortest path tree)
PIM sends hello packets to 224.0.0.13 every 30 seconds
PIM keeps track of both source/destination unlike IGPs
PIM populates the Mrouter Table
performs RPF checks by default - this requires an IGP
PIM-RP the central focus point where the receiver joins the network by sending it's report 
the default gateway with send its pim join to the RP, this builds the share tree 
the source also sends it multicast data down to the RP to complete the shared tree - 224.0.0.13
