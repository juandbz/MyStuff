Redistribution: Understanding Route Redistribution Concepts
.Why you would do route redistrubution?
.The process of route redistrubution
.Potential redistrubution issues

Why Redistribution?
1. The Politics of networking
2. Conversion between routing protocols
3. Vendor selection
4. Application/Business requirements

Prevent 
. Sub-Optimal Routing
. Routing Loops

What are Prefix Lists?
.An Improvement on Access Lists for matching routes
	- Improved Processor Utilization
	- Better Subnet mask matching abilities
.Similar "Structure" as ACLs
.Two Stage matching system: Network + Mask
.This will hurt your brain, but make you feel cool

What are Route Maps?
.An Ordered list of statements processed similar to an access list
.Perform a series of IF > THEN statements(Called Match/SET)
.Typically used for:
	- Modifying BGP attributes
	- Policy Routing
	- Route Filtering

Path Control: Using Policy-Based Routing
.Policy Routing: The 'Programming Language' of routing tables

	
BGP: Understanding Internet Connection Options

.How to connect to the Internet
.When You should and should not use BGP
.Reviewing the BGP Resume

When NOT to use BGP 
.You Dont have "Beefy" routers
.You're only connected to one External AS (ISP)
.You don't have enough bandwidth to receive updates
.You don't fully understand BGP

When to Use BGP
.You need high-availability through multiple ISPs
.You are a service provider
.Extremely large networks with "Demarc" points to other divisions or partners

BGP: The Resume
.Reliable updates (TCP-Based, port 179)
.Triggered updates only (5 seconds internal, 30 seconds, external)
.Complicated "metric" for finding the best route
.All neighbors are manually set up
.Complex filters are typically used
.The routing protocol of the internet
.management of trust and untrust
.Routing through autonomous systems instead of routers
.The slowest routing protocol in the world
.Primarily service provider, but also enterprise customer

BGP: Understanding BGP Neighbor Relationships
.How BGP neighbors form
.BGP communication messages

How BGP Neighbors Form
.Neighbors never "discover" - manual config needed on both sides
.Neighbor must be reachable on TCP 179
.Multiple sessions to the same neighbor not permitted (they will drop)
."Network" command works differently with BGP than other routing protocols

BGP Packets				BGP States
Open					IDLE
Update					Active
Keepalive				Open Sent
Notification			Open Confirm
						Established

Understanding Key BGP Attributes:
What are BGP Attributes?
."Characteristics" attached to every route advertised
.Often used by BGP's route selection process
.Can be standard(well-known) or proprietary (Optional)

Well known BGP Attributes
Origin (Mandatoty)
AS-Path (Mandatoty)
Next Hop (Mandatoty)
Local Preference (Discretionary)
Atomic Aggregate (Discretionary)

BGP Path Selection Process 
1. Largest Weight (cisco proprietary)
2. Highest Local Preference (Discretionary - Industry standard)
3. Locally Originated
4. Shortest AS Path
5. Lowest Origin Type (i < e < ?)
6. Lowest MED (metric)
7. eBGP over iBGP
8. Lowest IGP metric to neighbor
<Maximum paths check>
9. Older route
10. Lowest Router ID
