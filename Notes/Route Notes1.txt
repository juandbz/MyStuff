What Benefits does eigrp give you over ospf?

When would a route not be considered as a feasible successor?

What values are set to/in the default eigrp metric calculation?



Why you would choose to use eigrp
1. Backup routes(fast convergence/DUAL)

2. Simple Configuration

3. Flexability in summarization

4. Unequal cost Load-Balancing

5. Combines best of distance vector and link state
(Limited routing information, But backup paths)

EIGRP Tables and Terminology

A router running eigrp maintains three tables:

- Neighbor table
   directly connected neighbors that are exchanging routes

- topology Table
  all successor/ feasible successor routes
  
- Routing Table


EIGRP Tables and Terminology

. Feasible distance(FD)
. Advertised Distance (AD)
. Successor 
. Feasible Successor
. Active Route
. Passive Route 

***To be considered a Feasible Successor,
The AD must be less than the FD of the 
Successor***

Understanding EIGRP Metric Calculation
. Bandwidth (K1)
. Delay (K3)
. Reliability (K4 and K5)
. Loading (K2)
. MTU

Real Default Metric = 256*(Slowest_BW + All_link_Delays)
BW = (10^7/BW)
Delay = (Delay in microseconds)
