PPP 3 phase
Link Establishment Phase
Authentication Phase(Optional)
Network Layer Protocol Phase


Link Establishment Phase[LCP]
	.Configure-Request(CONFREQ)
	.Configure-Ack(CONFACK)
	.Configure-Nak(CONFNAK)
	.Configure-Reject(CONFREJ)
Also use Terminate-Request/Terminate-Ack to request/confirm teardown
Echo-Request and Echo-Reply used for keepalives

Authentication Phase
	.Password Authentication Protocol(PAP)
	.Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol(CHAP)
	.Extensible Authentication Protocol(EAP)
	
Network Layer Protocol Phase
	Uses same 4 Configure-Request/Ack/Nak/Reject messages in LCP
	These messages are used agree on higher layer protocols like IPv4
	This is handled by the Network Control Protocols(NCP)
	
Advance PPP Features
	Compression:
	Protocol Field Compression(PFC) |negotiated by LCP
	Address and Control Field Compression(ACFC) |negotiated by LCP
	Compression of IP+TCP and IP+UDP+RTP |negotiated by IPCP
