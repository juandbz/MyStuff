IGMP(IPv4) - Internet Group Management Protocol
IGMP Snooping - creates a Multicast MAC table to forward traffic only 
			to where they need to go instead of flooding it
IGMP Filtering
MLDP - Multicast Listener Discovery Protocol(IPv6)
MLDP Snooping
PIM Snooping
OUI:
0100:5exx:xxxx(IPv4)MulticastL2 inject last 
3333:xxxx:xxxx(IPv6)MulticastL2 inject last 2 octets of IPv6 address

GDA - Group Destination Address
PIM - Protocol Independent multicast
IGMP - Between receiver(pc) and default gateway to joing GDA
============================================================================
IGMPv1 - IP Protocol 2 only has 2 Message Types
IGMP Query(General Query type code-0x11) - Sent by Router every min to check if anyone is listening to Mcast 
IGMP Membership Report(JOIN) - Sent(type code: 0x12) by Receiver to the router to subscribe Mcast feed
							and to keep Mcast stream from terminating by replying to IGMP Querys

224.0.0.1 - "All Multicast Host" address with a 0.0.0.0 in the GDA in Mcast header

Every min the IGMP Query is sent a host must reply with IGMP Membership Report
If no host is interested in the Mcast stream router will terminate Mcast stream after 3 Querys

1 Query is sent out per subnet needs 1 report back otherwise will terminate the stream
==============================================================================================
IGMPv2 - has 4 Message Types
IGMP Membership Report(JOIN) - Same as IGMPv1 expect type code: 0x16
IGMP Query(General Query or Group Membership Query) - Same as IGMPv1 sent to 224.0.0.1 all Multicast Host
IGMP Leave(type code 0x17) - "should" be sent by the receiver when disconnection from Mcast stream
						Sent to "All Multicast Routers" address of 224.0.0.2
Group-Specific Query - Sent after a Leave, Same as General query(sent every sec) sent to GDA instead of all host
					Terminates stream if no one responses with report after 3 Group-Specific Querys

IGMPv2 has a Max response time(10secs) that host must response back to IGMP Querys with a report
		When using Group-Specific Querys Max response-time is 1 second
Command to change IGMP Query interval - ip IGMP query-interval <secs>
Command to change IGMP Max response time - ip IGMP query-max-response-time <secs>
Command to change IGMP Group specific query - ip IGMP last-member-query-count<secs>
Command to change IGMP Max response time - ip IGMP last-member-query-interval<msecs>

IGMPv2 Querier elected by the lowest IP when using 2 or more IGMP Routers on same broadcast domain
Non-Queriers will become Querier if 255 secs go by and not see a query

Command to change IGMP "Other Querier Present Interval" - ip IGMP query-timeout<secs60-300>
=================================================================================
IGMPv3 - must be manually configured by source/receiver
v3 is "Source-Specific Multicast" receiver has the option to exclude/include to subscribe to certain feeds
Inside the Group Membership Query
Querier robustness variable - receiver will have this to come up with how long to resend reports
Querier Query interval code - secs to how often to send the query

Group Membership Report sent to new "All IGMPv3 Routers" address 224.0.0.22 instead of GDA
Record-Type field in report indicates to include or exclude source 

IGMP Snooping(RFC4541)
-Proxy reporting - rate-limits quantity of IGMP reports forwarded to Mcast Router(s)
-Switch will response to router's query with 1 of host's IGMP report
-If host sends a Leave Switch will response with a query unless configured for FastLeave/Immediate Leave
-Switch will only forward a Leave to router if all host leaves the streams

Command to configure Immediate Leave - ip igmp snooping fast-leave(under interface)
								or (globally) - ip igmp snooping vlan <id> immediate-leave
								
Switch dynamically learns of an mrouter by listening to IGMP Queries/PIM/DVMRP
Or can statically be learn with this command - ip igmp snooping vlan <id> mrouter learn{cgmp | pim-dvmrp}

If Source and Receiver is in same Vlan, switch still needs Mrouter Port
If this is the case make switch the IGMP querier so Mrouter doesnt have to be congested with Mcast traffic
  Command to do this - ip igmp snooping querier
  
Verification commands:
	show ip igmp snooping
	show ip igmp snooping mrouter
	show ip igmp snooping group

IGMP Filtering allows you to deny/allow groups with the following command
	ip igmp snooping access-group acl [vlan vlan_id]
	ip igmp snooping limit n [except acl] [vlan vlan_id]
	ip igmp snooping minimum-version 2 | 3

	ip igmp snooping filter interface <interface-name>[details | statistics]
=====================================================================================	
MLDP = Multicast Listener Discovery Protocol
MLDv1 based of IGMPv2
MLDv2 based of IGMPv3

MLDP - Multicast Listener Report Message same as IGMPv3
	sent to "all MLDP-capable routers" address FF02::16
==================================
PIM = Protocol Independent multicast
Multicast routing protocol
uses Unicast and Multicast Messages 224.0.0.13
