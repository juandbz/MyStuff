Hands-On Challenges - Working With Text Files
How to solve these coding challenges:

Write your solution in PyCharm or in your preferred Python IDE.

If your solution is not correct, then try to understand the error messages, watch the video again, rewrite the solution and test it again. Repeat this step until you get the correct solution.

Save the solution in a file for future reference or recap.



Challenge #1

Create a Python script that reads a text file into a list and then converts the list back into a string which is the entire file content.

Challenge #2

Create a Python function called tail that reads the last n lines of a text file. The function has two arguments: the file name and n (the number of lines to read). This is similar to the Linux `tail` command.

Example: tail('sample_file.txt', 5) will return the last 5 lines from sample_file.txt.

Challenge #3

Change the solution from the previous challenge so that the script that prints out the last n lines of the file refreshes the output every 3 seconds (as the file changes or updates). This is similar to `tail -f` Linux command

Challenge #5

Write a Python program that calculates the net amount of a bank account based on the transactions saved in a text file.

The file format is as following:

D:50

W:100

D means deposit while W means withdrawal.

Suppose that the following file is supplied to the program:

D:300

D:300

W:500

D:200

Then, the output should be: 300
